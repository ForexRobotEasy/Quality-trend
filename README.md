# Quality Trend

## Overview

Quality Trend is a forex trading software developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to analyze market trends, calculate trend strength, and provide unbiased analysis of the software's performance. This software uses a unique algorithm to determine the speed of trend growth or fall and detect imminent market changes. It also performs trading operations based on the calculated trends and market conditions.

## How it Works

The Quality Trend software works by utilizing various indicators and algorithms to analyze market trends and make informed trading decisions. Here is a breakdown of the main components and functions of the code:

### Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is responsible for initializing necessary variables and indicators used in the program.

### Trend Calculation

In the `OnTick()` function, the software calculates the trend strength and noisiness ratio using a unique algorithm. It then determines the speed of trend growth or fall and updates the indicator line to accurately represent the trend's direction.

### Trend Analysis

The software checks if the indicator line is above zero for an increasing trend, below zero for a falling trend, and near zero for a flat trend. It also detects imminent market changes and provides unbiased analysis of the software's performance.

### Trading Operations

Based on the calculated trends and market conditions, the software performs trading operations. The specific trading strategy and actions are not described in the provided code, as they may vary depending on the user's preferences and trading style.

### Resource Cleanup

The `OnDeinit()` function is responsible for cleaning up and releasing any resources used by the program.
